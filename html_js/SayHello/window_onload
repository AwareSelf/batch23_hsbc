JavaScript onload
In JavaScript, this event can apply to launch a particular function when the page 
is fully displayed. 
It can also be used to verify the type and version of the visitor's browser. 

We can check what cookies a page uses by using the onload attribute.

In HTML, the onload attribute fires when an object has been loaded. 
The purpose of this attribute is to execute a script when the associated element 
loads.

In HTML, the onload attribute is generally used with the <body> element to execute
 a script once the content (including CSS files, images, scripts, etc.) of the 
 webpage is completely loaded. 
 It is not necessary to use it only with <body> tag, as it can be used with 
 other HTML elements.

The difference between the document.onload and window.onload is: 
document.onload triggers before the loading of images and other external content.
It is fired before the window.onload. 
While the window.onload triggers when the entire page loads, including CSS files, 
script files, images, etc.

Syntax
window.onload = fun()
