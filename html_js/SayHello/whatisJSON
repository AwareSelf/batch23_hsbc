JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.

JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.

What is JSON?

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format
JSON is language independent *
JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

* The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, 
but the JSON format is text only. Code for reading and generating JSON data
 can be written in any programming language.
 
 
 This JSON syntax defines an employees object: an array of 3 employee records (objects):-
 {
	"employees":[
	             {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
  				 {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
  				 {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
			    ]
 }


The JSON Format Evaluates to JavaScript Objects
The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.

Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.

JSON Syntax Rules
Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays
Converting a JSON Text to a JavaScript Object
A common use of JSON is to read data from a web server, and display the data in a web page.

For simplicity, this can be demonstrated using a string as input.

First, create a JavaScript string containing JSON syntax:

let text = '{ "employees" : [' +
'{ "firstName":"John" , "lastName":"Doe" },' +
'{ "firstName":"Anna" , "lastName":"Smith" },' +
'{ "firstName":"Peter" , "lastName":"Jones" } ]}';
Then, use the JavaScript built-in function JSON.parse() to convert the string into a JavaScript object:

const obj = JSON.parse(text);
